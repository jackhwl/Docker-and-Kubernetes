## Section 2: Configuring Virtual Network Peering:
* Understand VNets:
  - Virtual Network (VNet): A communications and security boundary that enables Azure resources (virtual machines, storage accounts, App Services apps, Azure SQL Database instances) to communicate with each other securely.
* When multiple VNets Make Sense:
  - Saving Money: Share a network virtual appliance among several Vnets(service chaining)
  - Segmenting Workloads: NSGs and UDRs give you routing and traffic control
  - Securing Traffic: Private connectivity that uses the Microsoft backbone network
