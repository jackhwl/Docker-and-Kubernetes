* ARM Templates: Modular JSON Files with declarative Syntax for Infrastructure as Code
* An ARM template refers to an Azure Resource Manager template. It is a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file used for deploying and managing resources in Azure. ARM templates provide a declarative syntax for defining the desired state of Azure resources, including virtual machines, storage accounts, networks, and more. With an ARM template, you can define the resource configuration, dependencies, and other deployment settings in a structured manner. This allows for consistent and repeatable deployments, infrastructure as code practices, and version control of your Azure resources.
